# optical-flow
This is an optical flow alforithm to help determine the intermediate state between two pictures

The algorithm has three part. The first part utilize the Lukas Kanade Algorithm to perform basic optical flow. The second part improves the algorith from part A by utilizing the downsappling and upsampling pyramid strategies in visual computing. The third part utilizes the algorithm in part A to do frame extrapolation on images.
